                <h3>Bryce</h3>
                <p>I'm the idea-head behind the Lich and Lily comics. I studied creative writing and screenwriting, developing an interest in Pixar and Cartoon Network-style story development. My brain is straight-shooting, but my heart is a sappy romantic, which together make character interactions my favorite thing to bring to the page.</p>

                <h3>Amandi</h3>
                <p>I illustrate Lich and Lily comics! I've always had a passion for art and storytelling since I was 13. I originally designed these two Halloween characters in college while studying illustration, and now I'm excited to expand their world! Though the art industry is not for the faint-of-heart, it's my goal to bring a new perspective and impact to it through dynamic visual storytelling.</p>
